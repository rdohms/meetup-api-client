            "notes": " You may supply a limited number of API requests, typically 1 to 4, in one batch request using the required \"requests\" parameter.\n Each of these individual batched requests will be tallied separately the same way they would when making individual requests.\n The batch request itself will not be tallied. As such, batch requests can not be rate limited.\n The only failures that you should account for are an authentication failure or a malformed JSON encoding of requests provided with the \"requests\" parameter.\n\n#### Composing batch requests\n\n Requests should be provided within a JSON-encoded array in the following format attached the `requests` parameter\n within a POST body\n\n<pre>\n [{\n   \"path\": \"/2/member/self\",\n   \"ref\":  \"me\",\n   \"params\": {\n     \"only\": \"name,id\"\n   }\n }]\n</pre>\n\n Only \"path\" is required for HTTP GET requests. \"path\" represents the API path for the method. \"ref\" provides a way to tag a request in a batch\n with a label that you can associated with its response in the body of the batch response. This will default to the\n provided \"path\". You may also supply a \"params\" key with a JSON object representing the parameters provided for the\n request. At this time only HTTP GET, DELETE, and POST requests are supported. You may specify one of these as a \"method\" property of the request.\n Methods requiring a multipart form POST are currently not supported. You may also supply headers on a per request basis by adding a \"headers\" field to the\n JSON object representing the request as key value pairs of strings.\n\n#### Interpreting batch responses\n\n A response to a batch request will be in the format\n\n<pre>\n [{\n   \"path\": \"/2/member/self\"\n   \"status\": 200,\n   \"ref\": \"me\",\n   \"body\": {\n     \"id\": 1234,\n     \"name\": \"Noah\"\n   },\n   \"headers\": {\n     \"key\": \"value\"\n    }\n }]\n</pre>\n\n \"path\" is the path of the method invoked. \"status\" represents the HTTP status code returned for the request.\n \"ref\" is the name provided for the inbound request. \"body\" is the JSON-encoded response from the given API request.\n \"headers\" is a JSON-encoded object representing the headers returned for that request.\n These requests may fail the same way they would when making individual requests. The response will indicate these\n failures.\n\n In order to preserve server resources and return batch responses within a reasonable amount of time, individual requests may timeout\n if a response is not computed within a reasonable amount of time. This allows for some requests to fail and others to pass which is a nicer\n alternative to an all or nothing response timeout.\n A timed out request can be identified by inspecting its response's \"status\" field for a value of 504. A timed out response may look like.\n\n<pre>\n [{\n   \"status\" : 504,\n   \"body\" : {\n    \"errors\" : [{\"code\": \"request_timeout\", \"message\":\"request timed out\"}]\n   },\n   \"headers\" : { ... },\n   \"path\" : \"/end/point\",\n   \"ref\" : \"request_ref\"\n }]\n</pre>\n"
